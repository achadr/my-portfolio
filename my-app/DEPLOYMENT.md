   git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add: `RESEND_API_KEY` = your_api_key

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Your site will be live at `your-project.vercel.app`

5. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - Go to Project Settings > Domains
   - Add your custom domain
   - Update DNS records as instructed

### Option 2: Netlify

1. **Build Configuration**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`

2. **Deploy**
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Test live site thoroughly
- [ ] Check email delivery on production
- [ ] Verify custom domain works (if applicable)
- [ ] Submit to Google Search Console
- [ ] Share on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
- [ ] Monitor performance with Lighthouse
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)

## Common Issues

**Contact form not working?**
- Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in deployment platform
- Verify recipient email is verified in Resend
- Check deployment logs for errors

**Images not loading?**
- Verify image paths are correct
- Check image files exist in `/public` folder
- Ensure image optimization is working

**Build failing?**
- Run `npm run build` locally first
- Check TypeScript errors
- Verify all imports are correct

## Maintenance

- Regularly update dependencies: `npm update`
- Monitor security vulnerabilities: `npm audit`
- Keep content fresh (update projects, experience)
- Respond to contact form submissions promptly
